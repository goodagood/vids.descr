繁體中文和合本(CUVTraditional)

1 你們要讚美耶和華！
  你們要讚美耶和華的名！耶和華的僕人
  站在耶和華殿中；
  站在我們　神殿院中的，你們要讚美他！

2a

3 你們要讚美耶和華！
  耶和華本為善；
  要歌頌他的名，因為這是美好的。

4 耶和華揀選雅各歸自己，
  揀選以色列特作自己的子民。

5  原來我知道耶和華為大，
   也知道我們的主超乎萬　神之上。

6  耶和華在天上，在地下，在海中，
  在一切的深處，都隨自己的意旨而行。

7  他使雲霧從地極上騰，造電隨雨而閃，
  從府庫中帶出風來。

8 他將埃及頭生的，連人帶牲畜都擊殺了。

9 埃及啊，他施行神蹟奇事，在你當中，
  在法老和他一切臣僕身上。

10 他擊殺許多的民，又殺戮大能的王，

11 就是亞摩利王西宏和巴珊王噩，
   並迦南一切的國王，

12 將他們的地賞賜他的百姓以色列為業。

13 耶和華啊，你的名存到永遠！
   耶和華啊，你可記念的名存到萬代！

14 耶和華要為他的百姓伸冤，為他的僕人後悔。

15外邦的偶像是金的，銀的，是人手所造的；

16 有口卻不能言，有眼卻不能看，

17 有耳卻不能聽，口中也沒有氣息。

18 造他的要和他一樣，凡靠他的也要如此。

19 以色列家啊，你們要稱頌耶和華！
   亞倫家啊，你們要稱頌耶和華！

20 利未家啊，你們要稱頌耶和華！
   你們敬畏耶和華的，要稱頌耶和華！

21 住在耶路撒冷的，耶和華該從錫安受稱頌。你們要讚美耶和華！

pss.135

[1] Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the name of the LORD; 
    praise him, O ye servants of the LORD.
[2] Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, 
    in the courts of the house of our God,
[3] Praise the LORD; for the LORD is good: 
    sing praises unto his name; for it is pleasant.
[4] For the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto himself, 
    and Israel for his peculiar treasure.
[5] For I know that the LORD is great, 
    and that our Lord is above all gods.

[6] Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that did he in heaven, 
    and in earth, in the seas, and all deep places.

[7] He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth;
    he maketh lightnings for the rain;
        he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries.
[8] Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast.

[9] Who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee,
    O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants.

[10] Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings;

[11] Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan,
     and all the kingdoms of Canaan:

[12] And gave their land for an heritage,
     an heritage unto Israel his people.

[13] Thy name, O LORD, endureth for ever;
     and thy memorial, O LORD, throughout all generations.

[14] For the LORD will judge his people,
     and he will repent himself concerning his servants.

[15] The idols of the heathen are silver and gold,
     the work of men's hands.

[16] They have mouths, but they speak not;
     eyes have they, but they see not;

[17] They have ears, but they hear not;
     neither is there any breath in their mouths.

[18] They that make them are like unto them:
     so is every one that trusteth in them.

[19] Bless the LORD, O house of Israel:
     bless the LORD, O house of Aaron:

[20] Bless the LORD, O house of Levi:
     ye that fear the LORD, bless the LORD.

[21] Blessed be the LORD out of Zion,
     which dwelleth at Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD.
